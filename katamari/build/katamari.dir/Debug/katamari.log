  -- Selecting Windows SDK version 10.0.18362.0 to target Windows 10.0.18363.
  CMake Deprecation Warning at glfw-3.2/CMakeLists.txt:10 (cmake_policy):
    The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
    of CMake.
  
    The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
    policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
    specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
    behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
